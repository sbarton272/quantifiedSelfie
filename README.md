Quantified Selfie
=================

This project was for Interactive Art and Computational Design Spring 2014

The code is messy. Most files were one-off scripts that I wrote to simpley get through the process of cleaning, filtering and analyzing my data. 

The final visualization is in the analysis/website directory. This visualization can be seen at http://sbarton272.github.io/quantifiedSelfie

I have not included my data in this repo as it is fairly personal data.
